# The Tracer Project

## Unfinished. Experimental. Use at your own risk, prefferably only if you know exactly what you're doing. Distributed under the extremely permissive GLWTS license.

### The project's purpose is clear to anyone capable enough to use more than two braincells. The code is commented. Meta-commentary will be provided on Wednesday (but I won't tell you which one).
